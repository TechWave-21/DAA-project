# 🧠 Data Structure Visualizer

An interactive Python application to visualize popular **Sorting** and **Graph Traversal** algorithms. Built using **Tkinter**, this tool helps students and developers understand how algorithms work through animated visualizations.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Sorting Visualizations:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Quick Sort

- ✅ Graph Traversal Visualizations:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Dijkstra’s Algorithm
  - Prim’s Algorithm

- ✅ Additional Highlights:
  - Real-time animated canvas
  - Adjustable visualization speed
  - Multi-threaded interface (smooth GUI)
  - Clean and user-friendly interface

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Tkinter** for GUI
- **Threading** for smooth animations
- **Heapq** for priority queue operations

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
